# pumpal - workout tracker application
### This is a Java Spring Boot web application using Bootstrap and Thymeleaf for sharing and tracking workouts. The data is persisted in a relationals MySQL database system making usage of ORM. This project was made for my SoftwareEngineering module at OTH.

Pumpal gives user the opportunity to keep track of their workouts, share those with friends, get inspired by others workouts and save them for later, and much more. 
Pumpal supports sportive people in connecting with other like-minded people by enabling friendships, offering comment sections to each workout and making it possible to filter public workouts by different criterias(intensity level, search terms,..). 

Shortly you'll be able to access documents showcasing the application's general structure in the form of a Class-, Component- and Usecasediagramm. Also there will be further and more detailed information regarding the individual Usecases.
